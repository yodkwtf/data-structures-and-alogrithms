## Dynamic Programming (DP)

It is just an optimizing technique using **caching**. It is a way of breaking down a problem into smaller sub problems and solving each of them one by one.

We solve every sub problem only once and store the value incase we get the same sub problem for the next item.

#### Memoization

It's a specific form of caching where we cache the return value of a function for a given parameter so if the function is called with the same parameter again, we returned that cache value instead of running all the operations again.
