## Dynamic Programming (DP)

It is just an optimizing technique using **caching**. It is a way of breaking down a problem into smaller subproblems and solving each of them one by one.

We solve every sub-problem only once and store the value in case we get the same sub-problem for the next item.

#### Memoization

It's a specific form of caching where we cache the return value of a function for a given parameter so if the function is called with the same parameter again, we return that cache value instead of running all the operations again.
