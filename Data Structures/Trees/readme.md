## Trees

Trees follow a hierarchal structure unlike arrays/linked lists which follow linear structure. Trees have a parent root node at the top connected to it's child nodes. Each node can have 0 or more than 0 child nodes.

The child nodes can form a subtree of their own and the ones that don't have any more child attached to them are called leaves (basically the ones at the most bottom level).

Best example - HTML code structure where <html> is the root and <head> & <body> are child with more child nodes.

There are tons of different types of trees, each used for specific purpose. Some of the most popular ones are **Binary Trees**, **Heaps**, **Tries**, etc.
