## Stacks and Queues

- Both linear data structure which allow us to traverse sequentially, i.e., one by one
- Pretty similar and can be implemented in similar ways
- Main diff. is how items get removed

Unlike arrays there's no random access operations. These mainly include operations that deal with elements either at beginning or end of the data structure (push, pop, etc.).

We can built stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists but with a lesser no. of operations.
