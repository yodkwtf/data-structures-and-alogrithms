## Stacks and Queues

- Both linear data structure which allow us to traverse sequentially, i.e., one by one
- Pretty similar and can be implemented in similar ways
- Main diff. is how items get removed

Unlike arrays, there are no random access operations. These mainly include operations that deal with elements either at the beginning or end of the data structure (push, pop, etc.).

We can build stacks and queues using arrays and linked lists but with a lesser no. of operations.
